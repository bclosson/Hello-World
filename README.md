# Hello-World
Executive Chef career changing to become a developer!  Wish me luck!

Hello Everyone,

After 24 years working in creative kitchens and leading great teams, I've decided to make a career shift to be a developer/programmer.  It's an intimidating move especially since I've not done any coding before, but after immersing myself in code the last couple months (html, css, javascript) I think I'm on the right track.  I love the challenge and how I'm using my brain in a completely new way!  I'm excited for what the future will bring!
